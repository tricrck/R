# 2.From the Murder data file, use the variable murder, which is the murder rate (per 100,000 population) 
      # for each state in the U.S. in 2017 according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports. 
      # At first, do not use the observation for D.C. (DC). Using software:
murder <- read.table("http://stat4ds.rwth-aachen.de/data/Murder.dat", 
                      header=TRUE)

# removing DC from observation which is observation number 51
murder1 <- murder[-c(51), ]

# a. Find the mean and standard deviation and interpret their values.

mean(murder1$murder)

sd(murder1$murder)
#
#
## From the mean and standard deviation we observed that the mean murder is 4.874 in the U.S. 
#  in 2017 according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports which represents the central tendancy of murder which low and,
#   a standard deviation of 2.586291, which is low and more data is clustered around the mean.
#
#

# b. Find the five-number summary, and construct the corresponding boxplot.
# Five summary with R's fivenum()
fivenum(murder1$murder)

# construct the corresponding boxplot

boxplot(murder1$murder,horizontal=TRUE)

## From the mean and standard deviation we observed that the mean murder is 4.874

# c. Now include the observation for D.C. What is affected more by this outlier: The mean or the median? 
# mean deviation
# use murder dataframe as it included D.C
mean(murder$murder) - mean(murder1$murder)
# median deviation
median(murder$murder) - median(murder1$murder)
